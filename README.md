# Start your own "Can of Books" App

This repository has starter code to begin work on creating your own online bookshelf.

## What can books do?

Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started


## Architecture
Node.js: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code on the server-side. In your code, you are using Node.js to run the book seeding script.

Mongoose: Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction for working with MongoDB and allows you to define data models and interact with the database using JavaScript objects.

MongoDB: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is a document-oriented database, and in your code, you are using Mongoose to define a Book schema and interact with the MongoDB database.

Book Model: You are defining a Book model using Mongoose. The model specifies the structure of the data that will be stored in the database, including properties like title, description, and status.

Seeding Script: The provided code is a seeding script that populates the MongoDB database with sample book data. It creates instances of the Book model and saves them to the database using Mongoose's methods.
